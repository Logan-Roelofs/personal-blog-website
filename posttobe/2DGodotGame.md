This post is all about how to get started with a bare bones 2d "racing" game where your only goal is to avoid on coming obsticales. 

## Setting up our project

First off we need to have Godot installed, go to https://godotengine.org/download/ and download Godot Engine - .NET that way we can use C# for our scripts. 

After this is isntalled create a new project and call it whatever you would like. For me I will call it racer.

Now lets take care of some maitnece, make 3 folders in your fileSystem tab one for Assets, Scenes, and Scripts. 

## Making sprite sheets 

Now we need to create some assets for our game. In my case I am going for a retro 16 bit 

## Code

```powershell
```
